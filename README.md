## Introduction
This project implemented the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. Numba, C++ and Cholesky Decomposition were utilized to optimize the performance of the code. The algorithm was applied on simulated dataset and tested on a handwritten digits classification task using the MNIST dataset, compared to SGLD and SGD with momentum methods. The package was created and published on TestPyPI.
